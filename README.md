TraySlider
=======
TraySlider is a cocos2d-x object that offers a fairly plain, tappable button featuring the selected item from a user-defined Vector of Sprites. This button, when clicked, extends a tray of additional items from the same Vector. These items can be tapped themselves, which will cause the item in question to be made the active/selected item featured on the button. The tray's selected item can be accessed through the `getSelected()` method.
